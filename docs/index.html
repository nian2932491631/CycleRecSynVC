<h3>Abstract: </h3>
Recognition-synthesis based any-to-one voice conversion (VC) approach extracts content-related features (e.g., phonetic posteriorgrams or bottleneck features)
from a source speech using an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model and then sends them into a synthesizer to predict the acoustic features of a target speaker.
However, the synthesizer is trained taking the content-related features of the target speaker as input.
This inconsistency between training and conversion stages constrains the speaker similarity of the converted speech because the content-related features inevitably contain speaker-dependent information.
To address this issue, a cyclic training method is proposed in this paper.
In this method, acoustic features of the target speaker are first fed into the ASR model and an auxiliary synthesizer sequentially to generate pseudo-source acoustic features with diverse speaker characteristics,
which are then sent back into the ASR model and the target synthesizer  to generate cyclicly reconstructed acoustic features. The reconstruction loss is adopted to optimize the target synthesizer. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed method achieved more consistent accuracies of acoustic feature prediction for various source speakers than the baseline recognition-synthesis based method. It also achieved better similarity performance, especially for the pair of source and target speakers with distant speaker characteristics.
